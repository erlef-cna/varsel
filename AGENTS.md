This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any
  pending issues
- Before committing, check whether your change affects the security posture
  described in `THREAT_MODEL.md` — what is in or out of scope (§3), trust
  boundaries and reachability (§4), roles/authorization, inputs and their sinks
  (§6), outbound egress, or the properties provided/disclaimed (§8/§9). If it
  does, update `THREAT_MODEL.md` (and the `SECURITY.md` Scope section if scope
  shifted) in the **same** commit so the model never drifts from the code.
  §12 lists the changes that trigger a revision — check your change against it
  rather than guessing. Do not add a claim you cannot point at code for, and do
  not restate what the code already says; the model records the contract, not
  the implementation.
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP
  requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by
  default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps
- Pre-commit hooks (`prek`) run credo, dialyzer, format, reuse and sobelow.
  **Never pass `--no-verify`.** A failing hook names a real problem: add the
  missing SPDX header, run `mix format`, fix the finding. If a failure looks
  unfixable, stop and ask rather than bypassing.
- Never use `@impl true`; name the behaviour (`@impl Phoenix.LiveView`,
  `@impl GenServer`, `@impl Ash.Type`). It documents which contract the
  function fulfills and lets the compiler check the callback belongs to it.

### Commits and PRs

- **Never put an AI-attribution footer in a PR title or description.** PR
  descriptions become the squashed commit message and stay content-only.
- **The `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer on a commit depends on who did the
  work.** A feature the assistant designed and wrote gets it. A change the
  author diagnosed and directed, where the assistant applied a small mechanical
  fix, does not. Judge per commit; include it when genuinely split.

### Writing style

Applies to code comments, moduledocs, commit messages, `THREAT_MODEL.md` and
every other doc in this repo.

- **Comments earn their place or don't exist.** Write one only for a
  constraint, trade-off or gotcha the code cannot express, ideally one imposed
  *elsewhere* (another module's cascade, an upstream API's rules, a spec), since
  that survives local edits. The test: would this go stale if someone changed
  the code below it? Then it was describing the code, and describing the code is
  what the code is for. Default to none.
- **Document what is, not what is not.** State the positive fact and stop. No
  justifying an absence, no "rather than X", no contrasting with the approach
  you didn't take. Reasoning about why a shape was chosen belongs in the commit
  message, where it does not rot.
- Moduledocs say what the module is *for*. Mechanics belong in the code.
- **Go easy on em dashes.** Prefer a full stop, a colon, or a comma. Keep the
  occasional one where it genuinely earns the pause; more than one per
  paragraph means rewriting most of them.
- When a change alters who can do what, grep the docs and moduledocs that
  describe it. A stale doc is worse than none.

### Editing THREAT_MODEL.md

The model's value is that a triager reads only what they cannot derive, so the
bar for adding anything is high. Before adding, find whether an existing section
already covers it generally (§4 default-deny and policies-decide-everywhere, §6
"all action parameters are attacker-controlled … the exceptions worth tabulating
are where input *content* reaches a sensitive sink"). If it does, add nothing.

- §5 is the side-effect inventory: things crossing **out** of the process
  (egress, subprocess, email, disk). A write to the app's own Postgres is not a
  host side effect, not even `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`.
- §6a "outputs and expected sinks" means sinks where output shape or safety
  matters to the receiver (HTML/XML, leaky URLs). An API response *schema*
  change is API documentation (`priv/pages/api-access.md`), not a sink.
- §11a known-non-findings earn a place only by correcting a **misreading**. A
  static query with no caller input is not misread, so it gets no entry. Never
  put a false claim in an entry header even to rebut it.
- Cut parentheticals restating an example already named in the previous
  sentence.

Verify claims by running code rather than reasoning from the DSL: call an action
as anonymous, role-less and POC to prove default-deny.

### Authorization guidelines

Authorization lives in Ash policies and nowhere else. The router runs one
`:live_user` hook that resolves the actor; it does not gate by role. A page a
caller may not have is refused by the first action it runs, and that refusal
renders the error page (401 when nobody is signed in, 403 otherwise — see
`lib/varsel_web/policy_status.ex`).

**Never hand-write a permission check in the web layer.** No
`user.role == :poc`, no `:if={@current_user}` standing in for "may they".
Ask the domain:

```elixir
# Every code-interface `define` generates can_<name> and can_<name>? for free.
Varsel.Cases.can_approve_case?(actor, case_record, validate?: true)

# Action-level form — no record needed, for affordances with no particular row.
Ash.can?({Varsel.Cases.Case, :read}, actor)
```

- **Pass `validate?: true`** for anything with a state machine or an action
  validation. The default is `false`, which consults policies ONLY and happily
  returns `true` for `:approve` on a closed case.
- **Ask about the action the affordance performs**, and prefer the resource
  the page is about. A button that runs `:reject` asks `can_reject_*?`; a nav
  link to a list asks `{Resource, :read}`.
- **Genuine identity checks are fine** — showing an avatar, a sign-out link, a
  "you" badge. Those are not permissions.

**Strict vs filter checks — the thing that surprises people.** A *strict*
check (`actor_present()`, `actor_attribute_equals`) decides before any query
and produces a `Forbidden` error. A *filter* check (`relates_to_actor_via`,
`expr(id == ^actor(:id))`) authorizes the action and narrows the rows, so an
unauthorized caller gets `{:ok, []}` — and `can?` returns **true**, because
the action *is* authorized. Both are denials.

Consequence: a private resource needs an explicit strict policy for `can?` to
gate anything, and for an anonymous read to refuse rather than come back
empty:

```elixir
policy always() do
  access_type :strict          # without this it is a filter check and cannot decide
  authorize_if actor_present()
end
```

Write it as `authorize_if`, not `forbid_unless`: policies are solved by a SAT
solver, and a policy whose checks can only forbid never *authorizes*, so the
whole read filters to nothing — for everyone, including a POC.

**Some questions cannot be answered before the write.** A create whose policy
reaches through a relationship (`Comment.post` via `[:case, :assignments,
:user]`) is `:unknown` at the strict step, since the row does not exist yet;
no option fixes it. Ask about the parent instead — `Ash.can?({case_record,
:read}, actor)` answers the same POC-or-assigned question, before the write.

**`authorize?: false` is banned in app code**, whatever the generic Ash rules
below say. `AshCredo.Check.Warning.AuthorizeFalse` enforces it (`.credo.exs`
excludes only `test`). Tests may use it. Route around it by case:

- *User-facing action refused by policy?* Add it to the resource policy and pass
  the actor. Page-level `on_mount` gating is not a substitute for action-layer
  policies.
- *System or background op* (Oban `run fn`, generic action, notifier)? Forward
  the AshOban context with `Varsel.ObanContext.forward(context)` and pass the
  returned opts to the nested call. It re-adds the private `ash_oban?` flag only
  when the outer context already had it, which clears the resource's
  `AshObanInteraction` bypass. The helper exists because `Ash.Context.to_opts`
  drops that flag on its own. Writes reached *through* `manage_relationship` do
  not inherit it, so use `accessing_from` there.
- *Row only ever written via a managed relationship?* Authorize by provenance:
  `authorize_if accessing_from(ParentResource, :relationship_name)`. For a
  many_to_many join the name is `:<name>_join_assoc`.
- *Reading a public resource?* Just drop the flag; an actor-less authorized read
  passes.
- *Render/derivation internals needing full case data?* Thread the actor; an
  actor who can read a case can read its children.

⚠️ `# credo:disable-for-next-line` for these compiled checks must sit directly
above the flagged token: for a multi-line call, above the line that opens it;
for a pipe, above the piped segment.

Nested calls that must run as someone other than the caller take
`actor: <that actor>` explicitly. Do not express a permission as
`context_equals`: action context is ambient state that any code path can set on
its way in, and it carries no relationship to who is asking. It says "this call
came through some code", not "this caller may do this". Authorize on the actor
and the row.

**Inspecting policies.** To see what a resource actually decides, rather than
guessing:

```elixir
Ash.Policy.Info.policies(Resource)                    # conditions + checks + access_type
Ash.Policy.Policy.expression(policies, check_context) # the combined boolean expression
```

The `access_type` on each check is what tells you whether it can refuse up
front. To check behaviour rather than structure, read the resource as each
actor (`Ash.read(Resource, actor: nil)`) and compare against
`Ash.count!(Resource, authorize?: false)` — an empty result with rows present
is a filter policy working, not a missing one.

A refused error carries `.facts` (each check mapped to true/false/`:unknown`)
and `.actor`; that pair is how `policy_status.ex` tells 401 from 403.
`run_queries?: false` is not a strictness knob; it collapses everything to
false.

**Checks are walked in source order and the first decisive one halts.** So
`authorize_if poc` / `forbid_if <arg present>` / `authorize_if supporter` reads
exactly as written: a POC never reaches the forbid. Filter expressions need a
row, so they work in neither a strict policy nor on a generic action. Making an
action an `update` is what buys per-row filter policies.

**Policies are load-bearing. Think about what a change permits, not just what it
was meant to permit**, including on surfaces not exposed today. The policy is
what will hold when one appears.

### Migrations

Migrations are **incremental**. A schema change gets a new named
`mix ash.codegen <name>` migration on top of the existing ones. Never wipe or
regenerate `initial_schema`, and never delete an applied migration (including a
`*_dev.exs` from codegen): a live dev database is running against them, and
undoing that by hand falls to the person whose database it is. Fix forward with
a new migration instead. The hand-rolled `add_oban` migration must be preserved
as-is.

⚠️ **Non-interactive codegen turns a column rename into `remove` + `add`**,
which drops the data. It does print a destructive-operation warning, easy to
miss in tailed output. Always read a generated migration that touches an
existing column and rewrite it as a real rename:

```elixir
rename table(:users), :email, to: :notification_email
```

Index drop/create around it is fine as generated. Confirm `down` round-trips by
rolling back once.

Use `MIX_ENV=test` for compile and verify loops. `mix compile --force` in the
default dev env recompiles the whole tree and disrupts the running dev server.

### Resource patterns

**State integrity.** All four state-machine resources (Case, CveRecord,
VulnerabilityReport, Proposal) carry `attribute :version, :integer` plus a
resource-global `change optimistic_lock(:version), on: [:update]`, so a stale
server-loaded snapshot fails with `StaleRecord`. That lock is what entitles
policies and validations to trust `changeset.data`. `ValidNextState` sits
**above** the AshOban bypass and exists for pre-flight `Ash.can?` visibility;
enforcement stays with `transition_state`.

Exempt an update from the lock only when it runs nested inside another update on
the same row, or when concurrent unrelated writers would otherwise collide
(`:refresh_derivation`, `:grant_access` on Case).

**Content freezes are policies checking the current row**
(`expr(state in [...])`, `expr(case.state in [...])`), never validations reading
`changeset.data`.

⚠️ On calculation-backed identities, `upsert_condition` works, but
`return_skipped_upsert?` and `return_records?` on bulk upserts do not: the
record-to-changeset mapping is keyed on identity attributes the changeset never
has, so `BulkResult.records` comes back empty. Query state up front instead of
reading the bulk result.

### Testing

- **Never `=~` against a raw response body or an `inspect` string.** Decode and
  pattern match the structure; a final `=~` on one extracted string field is
  fine.
- **A mutating LiveView test must end on a `render(lv)`-based assertion**, never
  a bare `render_click`/`render_submit` plus a database assert. The reload
  happens one message after the event reply and the trailing render flushes it.
  Without it the LiveView dies mid-query at test end, giving flaky
  `DBConnection.ConnectionError` sandbox disconnects.
- Sorting timestamps needs the module sorter:
  `Enum.sort_by(x, & &1.inserted_at, DateTime)`. A bare `sort_by` compares
  structs field-alphabetically (`:microsecond` before `:minute`), which flips
  order across second boundaries and only fails when timestamps straddle one.
- HTTP clients are mocked through config: `Req.Test` plugs for Req-based
  clients, the `hex_core` HTTP adapter for hex.pm. See `config/test.exs`.

### LiveView conventions

**Notification-driven reloads.** Subscribed LiveViews use
`AshPhoenix.LiveView.keep_live`, and `VarselWeb.LiveNotifications` (an
`on_mount` hook in both router live_sessions) intercepts broadcasts at the
`handle_info` stage. LiveViews write **no** `handle_info` for notifications and
no hand-rolled reload functions; the pub_sub echo is the reload path. The hook
drains queued same-topic broadcasts before refetching, because a reorder or bulk
sync emits one notification per row.

**Forms.** Data-entry LiveViews use `AshPhoenix.Form` with inline per-field
errors via `<.input>`. Build with `for_create`/`for_update(..., as: "form",
actor: current_user) |> to_form()`, validate on change, and re-assign the form
on `{:error, form}`. Derived non-attribute inputs stay outside the form struct
and are merged into params before submit. `<.input>`'s `label` is a **slot**,
not a string attr. Per-row single-control list actions in `keep_live` lists stay
raw by choice.

⚠️ **Never name a `phx-value-*` param `value`.** The browser clobbers it with
the element's DOM value, and tests do not catch it since they send what you
tell them to. Use `selection`, `choice`, `row_id`, anything else.

### Dev-only code

Developer tooling lives in the **`dev/` directory**, which is in `elixirc_paths`
for `:dev` and `:test` only. A compile-time config flag is not enough: Elixir
resolves `import Foo.Bar` even inside an `if false` branch it discards, so a
dev-only dependency breaks the prod compile however the branch is guarded. Only
"not compiled at all" works. Plugs are fine in a dead branch since they are not
resolved.

- New dev-only module goes in `dev/` with no `if` wrapper inside it.
- Fragments inside always-compiled modules guard with
  `Mix.env() in [:dev, :test]` (compile-time only; Mix is absent in releases).
- `VarselWeb.DevRouter` is forwarded at the root, last, and declares full
  `/dev/...` paths itself, because these tools build redirects from their mount
  path and cannot see through a forward.
- Dev-only components need `use Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes, router:
  VarselWeb.DevRouter`, and Tailwind scans `dev/` via an `@source` in app.css.

### sobelow

Prose after the directive crashes the parser: `# sobelow_skip ["SQL.Query"] -
because X` makes sobelow parse the trailing text as Elixir and exit 1 with an
`Enumerable.impl_for!/1` stacktrace and zero findings printed, which looks like
an unrelated crash. Put the reason on its own comment line **above** the
directive.

`.sobelow-skips` pins `file:line`, so inserting anything above a skipped
construct shifts its line and resurfaces a finding unrelated to your change.
Regenerate the file with `mix sobelow --mark-skip-all`, then restore the SPDX
header and the comment explaining each skip, which the rewrite drops. To tell
whether a finding is yours or pre-existing, `git stash push -u` and re-run.

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
  custom classes must fully style the input

### JS and CSS guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.

- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`:

  ```
  @import "tailwindcss" source(none);
  @source "../css";
  @source "../js";
  @source "../../lib/my_app_web";
  ```

- **Always use and maintain this import syntax** in the app.css file for projects generated with `phx.new`

- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css

- This app **does** use daisyUI 5 (`assets/vendor/daisyui.js`, two themes defined in
  `app.css`). Use its components — `card`, `badge`, `btn`, `select`, `input`,
  `alert`, `toast` — rather than rebuilding them, and layer the EEF tokens and
  named classes on top. See the UI/UX section below

- Out of the box **only the app.js and app.css bundles are supported**

  - You cannot reference an external vendor'd script `src` or link `href` in the layouts
  - You must import the vendor deps into app.js and app.css to use them
  - **Never write inline <script>custom js</script> tags within templates**

### UI/UX & design guidelines

This app has an established design system — daisyUI 5 themes plus EEF brand tokens
in `assets/css/app.css`. Work inside it rather than inventing a look per screen.

- **Both themes are first-class.** Light and dark ship together and `base-100`
  inverts between them: it is the *page* on dark but a *raised white* on light, so
  a card that sits above a `base-200` panel cannot just use `bg-base-100` — on dark
  it would sink. That is what `--lane-card-bg` exists for. Check every UI change in
  both themes before calling it done.
- **Tokens, not ad-hoc color.** `base-100/200/300`, `--eef-navy`/`--eef-navy-2`/
  `--eef-blue`, the five-step `--sev-*` severity scale, `--violet` for the approved
  lane. Named classes carry the patterns: `.console-band`, `.eef-band`,
  `.page-header`, `.btn-eef` / `.btn-eef-quiet`, `.lane-card`, `.eef-eyebrow`,
  `.overlay-scrim`, `.timeline-track`. Reach for these before writing new CSS; if a
  value has no token, add one rather than inlining a hex.
- Status colors have fixed roles: warning amber (staleness, attention), info blue
  (**suggestions are always info-toned**), success green, error red.
- Severity chips: **critical is the only filled chip.** Weight, not hue, sets it
  apart, so the ranking survives color-blindness. Do not "fix" this by filling the
  other buckets.
- House rules: information-dense but calm; panels, not walls; one primary action
  per band; derive-at-render facts render as chips and tables — **never raw JSON
  where a human reads**.
- The public site is branded **"EEF CNA"**. "Varsel" is the tool's name and never
  appears in the UI.

#### Seeing your work: storybook and visual diff

Every rendering component in `lib/varsel_web/components` has a story under
`storybook/`. Use it — it is faster and more complete than driving the live app,
and it needs no login, no fixture data, and carries no risk of touching real case
state.

- `/dev/storybook` — browse. Each story page shows every variation **beside the
  exact HEEx call that produces it** (`<.severity_chip score={9.8} variant={:full}/>`),
  plus the component's doc, a Playground, and a Source tab. This is the place to
  find a component to reuse before writing new markup.
- `/dev/storybook/visual_tests/<folder>/<component>?theme=dark` — **all variations
  of one component on a single page.** Two navigations (`?theme=light` and
  `?theme=dark`) diff a component across both themes. Folders mirror the modules:
  `core`, `case`, `board`, `inputs`, `layout`.

Reading a `visual_tests` page correctly:

- Variations render **stacked and unlabeled** under one wrapper id. Identify them
  by story order and id from `storybook/<folder>/<name>.story.exs` — never by
  "the third row on screen".
- Variations that intentionally render nothing (e.g. `pagination`'s `no_results`)
  leave **no visual trace**. Check those in the DOM or the story source.
- It defaults to the **light** theme (the first configured one), whatever the
  storybook chrome around it looks like. A screenshot with no `?theme=` is light.
- Theme is a `data-theme` attribute on the sandbox, not on `<html>` — see the
  `data_attribute` strategy in `dev/storybook.ex`.

**New reusable markup gets a story.** When you extract a component, add
`storybook/<folder>/<name>.story.exs` with a variation per state and register it in
that folder's `_<folder>.index.exs`. A component without a story is invisible to
the next person and unreviewable in both themes.

⚠️ **Never name a component attr `id` if a story passes it.** Storybook consumes
`id` for the sandbox element's own DOM id, so the component receives that string
instead of what the variation passed. The failure is silent: the guard just
evaluates false, and a *negated* guard stays true, so the story looks right
while testing nothing. Name it `row_id`, `record_id`, `case_id`. Plain `id` is
fine for attrs that genuinely are the DOM id. Calling the component directly
through `project_eval` renders fine and hides this, so check the real storybook
page.

#### Seeing the live app

- Roles: the dev-tools launcher (bottom-right `</>` on any page) has a **MOCK SIGN
  IN** section — POC / Supporter / No role — but only when signed out; sign out via
  the user icon in the header first. Views that serve several audiences from one
  route (`/reports` is a triage queue for a POC and a personal list for everyone
  else) must be checked in each shape.
- The three-column case workspace needs ≥1024 CSS px. Never resize the user's
  Chrome window; report the width you have instead.
- Dev data is free to create. Publishing is safe only while the MITRE mock is
  active (no `MITRE_CVE_API_*` variables set — `Varsel.Dev.MitreCveApiMock`
  stands in and stamps dates locally). ⛔ **With MITRE credentials configured,
  NEVER publish a CVE, even in dev** — it hits MITRE's real API.

## usage_rules usage
_A config-driven dev tool for Elixir projects to manage AGENTS.md files and agent skills from dependencies_

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should *thoroughly* consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules *directly from the package authors*.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.

## Modules & functions in the current app and dependencies

When looking for docs for modules & functions that are dependencies of the current project,
or for Elixir itself, use `mix usage_rules.docs`

```
# Search a whole module
mix usage_rules.docs Enum

# Search a specific function
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip

# Search a specific function & arity
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip/1
```


## Searching Documentation

You should also consult the documentation of any tools you are using, early and often. The best 
way to accomplish this is to use the `usage_rules.search_docs` mix task. Once you have
found what you are looking for, use the links in the search results to get more detail. For example:

```
# Search docs for all packages in the current application, including Elixir
mix usage_rules.search_docs Enum.zip

# Search docs for specific packages
mix usage_rules.search_docs Req.get -p req

# Search docs for multi-word queries
mix usage_rules.search_docs "making requests" -p req

# Search only in titles (useful for finding specific functions/modules)
mix usage_rules.search_docs "Enum.zip" --query-by title
```


<!-- usage_rules-end -->
<!-- usage_rules:elixir-start -->
## usage_rules:elixir usage
# Elixir Core Usage Rules

## Pattern Matching
- Use pattern matching over conditional logic when possible
- Prefer to match on function heads instead of using `if`/`else` or `case` in function bodies
- `%{}` matches ANY map, not just empty maps. Use `map_size(map) == 0` guard to check for truly empty maps

## Error Handling
- Use `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples for operations that can fail
- Avoid raising exceptions for control flow
- Use `with` for chaining operations that return `{:ok, _}` or `{:error, _}`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Elixir has no `return` statement, nor early returns. The last expression in a block is always returned.
- Don't use `Enum` functions on large collections when `Stream` is more appropriate
- Avoid nested `case` statements - refactor to a single `case`, `with` or separate functions
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Lists and enumerables cannot be indexed with brackets. Use pattern matching or `Enum` functions
- Prefer `Enum` functions like `Enum.reduce` over recursion
- When recursion is necessary, prefer to use pattern matching in function heads for base case detection
- Using the process dictionary is typically a sign of unidiomatic code
- Only use macros if explicitly requested
- There are many useful standard library functions, prefer to use them where possible

## Function Design
- Use guard clauses: `when is_binary(name) and byte_size(name) > 0`
- Prefer multiple function clauses over complex conditional logic
- Name functions descriptively: `calculate_total_price/2` not `calc/2`
- Predicate function names should not start with `is` and should end in a question mark.
- Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards

## Data Structures
- Use structs over maps when the shape is known: `defstruct [:name, :age]`
- Prefer keyword lists for options: `[timeout: 5000, retries: 3]`
- Use maps for dynamic key-value data
- Prefer to prepend to lists `[new | list]` not `list ++ [new]`

## Mix Tasks

- Use `mix help` to list available mix tasks
- Use `mix help task_name` to get docs for an individual task
- Read the docs and options fully before using tasks

## Testing
- Run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` and a specific test with the line number `mix test path/to/test.exs:123`
- Limit the number of failed tests with `mix test --max-failures n`
- Use `@tag` to tag specific tests, and `mix test --only tag` to run only those tests
- Use `assert_raise` for testing expected exceptions: `assert_raise ArgumentError, fn -> invalid_function() end`
- Use `mix help test` to for full documentation on running tests

## Debugging

- Use `dbg/1` to print values while debugging. This will display the formatted value and other relevant information in the console.

<!-- usage_rules:elixir-end -->
<!-- usage_rules:otp-start -->
## usage_rules:otp usage
# OTP Usage Rules

## GenServer Best Practices
- Keep state simple and serializable
- Handle all expected messages explicitly
- Use `handle_continue/2` for post-init work
- Implement proper cleanup in `terminate/2` when necessary

## Process Communication
- Use `GenServer.call/3` for synchronous requests expecting replies
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget messages.
- When in doubt, use `call` over `cast`, to ensure back-pressure
- Set appropriate timeouts for `call/3` operations

## Fault Tolerance
- Set up processes such that they can handle crashing and being restarted by supervisors
- Use `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` to prevent restart loops

## Task and Async
- Use `Task.Supervisor` for better fault tolerance
- Handle task failures with `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2`
- Set appropriate task timeouts
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure

## ash usage
_A declarative, extensible framework for building Elixir applications._

# Rules for working with Ash

## Understanding Ash

Ash is an opinionated, composable framework for building applications in Elixir. It provides a declarative approach to modeling your domain with resources at the center. Read documentation  *before* attempting to use its features. Do not assume that you have prior knowledge of the framework or its conventions.

<!-- ash:actions-start -->
## ash:actions usage
# Actions

- Create specific, well-named actions rather than generic ones
- Put all business logic inside action definitions
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_action/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_action/2` to add additional logic
  inside the same transaction.
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_transaction/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_transaction/2` to add additional logic
  outside the transaction.
- Use action arguments for inputs that need validation
- Use preparations to modify queries before execution
- Preparations support `where` clauses for conditional execution
- Use `only_when_valid?` to skip preparations when the query is invalid
- Use changes to modify changesets before execution
- Use validations to validate changesets before execution
- Prefer domain code interfaces to call actions instead of directly building queries/changesets and calling functions in the `Ash` module
- A resource could be *only generic actions*. This can be useful when you are using a resource only to model behavior.
- Instead of defining functions in the domain, you should be defining actions and exposing them through code interface calls in the domain. Use standard actions when they fit what you're doing and generic actions when you need arbitrary functionality.

## Error Handling

Functions to call actions, like `Ash.create` and code interfaces like `MyApp.Accounts.register_user` all return ok/error tuples. All have `!` variations, like `Ash.create!` and `MyApp.Accounts.register_user!`. Use the `!` variations when you want to "let it crash", like if looking something up that should definitely exist, or calling an action that should always succeed. Always prefer the raising `!` variation over something like `{:ok, user} = MyApp.Accounts.register_user(...)`.

All Ash code returns errors in the form of `{:error, error_class}`. Ash categorizes errors into four main classes:

1. **Forbidden** (`Ash.Error.Forbidden`) - Occurs when a user attempts an action they don't have permission to perform
2. **Invalid** (`Ash.Error.Invalid`) - Occurs when input data doesn't meet validation requirements
3. **Framework** (`Ash.Error.Framework`) - Occurs when there's an issue with how Ash is being used
4. **Unknown** (`Ash.Error.Unknown`) - Occurs for unexpected errors that don't fit the other categories

These error classes help you catch and handle errors at an appropriate level of granularity. An error class will always be the "worst" (highest in the above list) error class from above. Each error class can contain multiple underlying errors, accessible via the `errors` field on the exception.

## Using Validations

Validations ensure that data meets your business requirements before it gets processed by an action. Unlike changes, validations cannot modify the changeset - they can only validate it or add errors.

Validations work on both changesets and queries. Built-in validations that support queries include:
- `action_is`, `argument_does_not_equal`, `argument_equals`, `argument_in`
- `byte_size`, `compare`, `confirm`, `match`, `negate`, `one_of`, `present`, `string_length`
- Custom validations that implement the `supports/1` callback

Common validation patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in validations with custom messages
validate compare(:age, greater_than_or_equal_to: 18) do
  message "You must be at least 18 years old"
end
validate match(:email, "@")
validate one_of(:status, [:active, :inactive, :pending])

# Conditional validations with where clauses
validate present(:phone_number) do
  where present(:contact_method) and eq(:contact_method, "phone")
end

# only_when_valid? - skip validation if prior validations failed
validate expensive_validation() do
  only_when_valid? true
end

# Action-specific vs global validations
actions do
  create :sign_up do
    validate present([:email, :password])  # Only for this action
  end
  
  read :search do
    argument :email, :string
    validate match(:email, ~r/^[^\s]+@[^\s]+\.[^\s]+$/)  # Validates query arguments
  end
end

validations do
  validate present([:title, :body]), on: [:create, :update]  # Multiple actions
end
```

- Create **custom validation modules** for complex validation logic:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Validations.UniqueUsername do
    use Ash.Resource.Validation

    @impl true
    def init(opts), do: {:ok, opts}

    @impl true
    def validate(changeset, _opts, _context) do
      # Validation logic here
      # Return :ok or {:error, message}
    end
  end

  # Usage in resource:
  validate {MyApp.Validations.UniqueUsername, []}
  ```

- Make validations **atomic** when possible to ensure they work correctly with direct database operations by implementing the `atomic/3` callback in custom validation modules.

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Validations.IsEven do
    # transform and validate opts

    use Ash.Resource.Validation

    @impl true
    def init(opts) do
      if is_atom(opts[:attribute]) do
        {:ok, opts}
      else
        {:error, "attribute must be an atom!"}
      end
    end

    @impl true
    # This is optional, but useful to have in addition to validation
    # so you get early feedback for validations that can otherwise
    # only run in the datalayer
    def validate(changeset, opts, _context) do
      value = Ash.Changeset.get_attribute(changeset, opts[:attribute])

      if is_nil(value) || (is_number(value) && rem(value, 2) == 0) do
        :ok
      else
        {:error, field: opts[:attribute], message: "must be an even number"}
      end
    end

    @impl true
    def atomic(changeset, opts, context) do
      {:atomic,
        # the list of attributes that are involved in the validation
        [opts[:attribute]],
        # the condition that should cause the error
        # here we refer to the new value or the current value
        expr(rem(^atomic_ref(opts[:attribute]), 2) != 0),
        # the error expression
        expr(
          error(^InvalidAttribute, %{
            field: ^opts[:attribute],
            # the value that caused the error
            value: ^atomic_ref(opts[:attribute]),
            # the message to display
            message: ^(context.message || "%{field} must be an even number"),
            vars: %{field: ^opts[:attribute]}
          })
        )
      }
    end
  end
  ```

- **Avoid redundant validations** - Don't add validations that duplicate attribute constraints:
  ```elixir
  # WRONG - redundant validation
  attribute :name, :string do
    allow_nil? false
    constraints min_length: 1
  end

  validate present(:name) do  # Redundant! allow_nil? false already handles this
    message "Name is required"
  end

  validate attribute_does_not_equal(:name, "") do  # Redundant! min_length: 1 already handles this
    message "Name cannot be empty"
  end

  # CORRECT - let attribute constraints handle basic validation
  attribute :name, :string do
    allow_nil? false
    constraints min_length: 1
  end
  ```

## Using Preparations

Preparations modify queries before they're executed. They are used to add filters, sorts, or other query modifications based on the query context.

Common preparation patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in preparations
prepare build(sort: [created_at: :desc])
prepare build(filter: [active: true])

# Conditional preparations with where clauses
prepare build(filter: [visible: true]) do
  where argument_equals(:include_hidden, false)
end

# only_when_valid? - skip preparation if prior validations failed
prepare expensive_preparation() do
  only_when_valid? true
end

# Action-specific vs global preparations
actions do
  read :recent do
    prepare build(sort: [created_at: :desc], limit: 10)
  end
end

preparations do
  prepare build(filter: [deleted: false]), on: [:read, :update]
end
```

## Using Changes

Changes allow you to modify the changeset before it gets processed by an action. Unlike validations, changes can manipulate attribute values, add attributes, or perform other data transformations.

Common change patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in changes with conditions
change set_attribute(:status, "pending")
change relate_actor(:creator) do
  where present(:actor)
end
change atomic_update(:counter, expr(^counter + 1))

# Action-specific vs global changes
actions do
  create :sign_up do
    change set_attribute(:joined_at, expr(now()))  # Only for this action
  end
end

changes do
  change set_attribute(:updated_at, expr(now())), on: :update  # Multiple actions
  change manage_relationship(:items, type: :append), on: [:create, :update]
end
```

- Create **custom change modules** for reusable transformation logic:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Changes.SlugifyTitle do
    use Ash.Resource.Change

    def change(changeset, _opts, _context) do
      title = Ash.Changeset.get_attribute(changeset, :title)

      if title do
        slug = title |> String.downcase() |> String.replace(~r/[^a-z0-9]+/, "-")
        Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :slug, slug)
      else
        changeset
      end
    end
  end

  # Usage in resource:
  change {MyApp.Changes.SlugifyTitle, []}
  ```

- Create a **change module with lifecycle hooks** to handle complex multi-step operations:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Changes.ProcessOrder do
    use Ash.Resource.Change

    def change(changeset, _opts, context) do
      changeset
      |> Ash.Changeset.before_transaction(fn changeset ->
        # Runs before the transaction starts
        # Use for external API calls, logging, etc.
        MyApp.ExternalService.reserve_inventory(changeset, scope: context)
        changeset
      end)
      |> Ash.Changeset.before_action(fn changeset ->
        # Runs inside the transaction before the main action
        # Use for related database changes in the same transaction
        Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :processed_at, DateTime.utc_now())
      end)
      |> Ash.Changeset.after_action(fn changeset, result ->
        # Runs inside the transaction after the main action, only on success
        # Use for related database changes that depend on the result
        MyApp.Inventory.update_stock_levels(result, scope: context)
        {changeset, result}
      end)
      |> Ash.Changeset.after_transaction(fn changeset,
        {:ok, result} ->
          # Runs after the transaction completes (success or failure)
          # Use for notifications, external systems, etc.
          MyApp.Mailer.send_order_confirmation(result, scope: context)
          {changeset, result}

        {:error, error} ->
          # Runs after the transaction completes (success or failure)
          # Use for notifications, external systems, etc.
          MyApp.Mailer.send_order_issue_notice(result, scope: context)
          {:error, error}
      end)
    end
  end

  # Usage in resource:
  change {MyApp.Changes.ProcessOrder, []}
  ```

## Atomic Changes

Atomic changes execute directly in the database as part of the update query, without requiring the record to be loaded first. This provides better performance and correct behavior under concurrent updates.

**Why atomic matters:**
- Avoids race conditions (e.g., incrementing a counter)
- Better performance (no round-trip to load the record)
- Required for bulk operations to work efficiently

**Built-in atomic changes:**
```elixir
# Increment a counter atomically
change atomic_update(:view_count, expr(view_count + 1))

# Set a value using an expression
change set_attribute(:updated_at, expr(now()))
```

**Making custom changes atomic:**
Implement the `atomic/3` callback to support atomic execution:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Changes.IncrementVersion do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  @impl true
  def change(changeset, _opts, _context) do
    # Fallback for non-atomic execution
    current = Ash.Changeset.get_attribute(changeset, :version) || 0
    Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :version, current + 1)
  end

  @impl true
  def atomic(_changeset, _opts, _context) do
    # Atomic implementation - runs in the database
    {:atomic, %{version: expr(coalesce(version, 0) + 1)}}
  end
end
```

## Using `require_atomic? false`

By default, update and destroy actions require all changes and validations to support atomic execution. If they don't, the action will raise an error.

**IMPORTANT:** When you see `require_atomic? false` on an action, carefully consider whether it is truly necessary. This option should be used sparingly.

**When `require_atomic? false` is needed:**
- The action has `before_action` or `around_action` hooks that need to read or modify the record
- A change reads the current record state (e.g., `Ash.Changeset.get_data/2`) and cannot be rewritten atomically
- Complex validations that cannot be expressed as database expressions

**When `require_atomic? false` is NOT needed:**
- Simple attribute transformations (these can usually be made atomic)
- Setting timestamps or default values (use `expr(now())` instead)
- Incrementing counters (use `atomic_update/2`)
- After-action hooks (these don't prevent atomic execution)
- After-transaction hooks (these don't prevent atomic execution)

```elixir
actions do
  update :update do
    # AVOID unless truly necessary
    require_atomic? false
  end

  update :increment_views do
    # GOOD - fully atomic, no need to disable
    change atomic_update(:view_count, expr(view_count + 1))
  end
end
```

If you find yourself adding `require_atomic? false`, first check if your changes and validations can be rewritten with `atomic/3` callbacks. Only disable atomic requirements when the action genuinely needs to read or manipulate the record in hooks.

## Custom Modules vs. Anonymous Functions

Prefer to put code in its own module and refer to that in changes, preparations, validations etc.

For example, prefer this:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _, _) do
    Ash.Changeset.before_action(changeset, fn changeset, _ ->
      slug = MyApp.Slug.get()
      Ash.Changeset.force_change_attribute(changeset, :slug, slug)
    end)
  end
end

change MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName
```

## Action Types

- **Read**: For retrieving records
- **Create**: For creating records
- **Update**: For changing records
- **Destroy**: For removing records
- **Generic**: For custom operations that don't fit the other types


<!-- ash:actions-end -->
<!-- ash:aggregates-start -->
## ash:aggregates usage
# Aggregates

Aggregates allow you to retrieve summary information over groups of related data, like counts, sums, or averages. Define aggregates in the `aggregates` block of a resource.

Aggregates can work over relationships or directly over unrelated resources:

```elixir
aggregates do
  # Related aggregates - use relationship path
  count :published_post_count, :posts do
    filter expr(published == true)
  end

  sum :total_sales, :orders, :amount

  exists :is_admin, :roles do
    filter expr(name == "admin")
  end

  # Unrelated aggregates - use resource module directly
  count :matching_profiles_count, Profile do
    filter expr(name == parent(name))
  end
  
  sum :total_report_score, Report, :score do
    filter expr(author_name == parent(name))
  end
  
  exists :has_reports, Report do
    filter expr(author_name == parent(name))
  end
end
```

For unrelated aggregates, use `parent/1` to reference fields from the source resource.

## Aggregate Types

- **count**: Counts related items meeting criteria
- **sum**: Sums a field across related items
- **exists**: Returns boolean indicating if matching related items exist (also supports unrelated resources)
- **first**: Gets the first related value matching criteria
- **list**: Lists the related values for a specific field
- **max**: Gets the maximum value of a field
- **min**: Gets the minimum value of a field
- **avg**: Gets the average value of a field

## Using Aggregates

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
users = MyDomain.list_users!(
  load: [:published_post_count, :total_sales],
  query: [
    filter: [published_post_count: [greater_than: 5]],
    sort: [published_post_count: :desc]
  ]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
User |> Ash.Query.filter(published_post_count > 5) |> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(users, :published_post_count)
```

### Join Filters

For complex aggregates involving multiple relationships, use join filters:

```elixir
aggregates do
  sum :redeemed_deal_amount, [:redeems, :deal], :amount do
    # Filter on the aggregate as a whole
    filter expr(redeems.redeemed == true)

    # Apply filters to specific relationship steps
    join_filter :redeems, expr(redeemed == true)
    join_filter [:redeems, :deal], expr(active == parent(require_active))
  end
end
```

## Inline Aggregates

Use aggregates inline within expressions:

```elixir
# Related inline aggregates
calculate :grade_percentage, :decimal, expr(
  count(answers, query: [filter: expr(correct == true)]) * 100 /
  count(answers)
)

# Unrelated inline aggregates
calculate :profile_count, :integer, expr(
  count(Profile, filter: expr(name == parent(name)))
)

calculate :stats, :map, expr(%{
  profiles: count(Profile, filter: expr(active == true)),
  reports: count(Report, filter: expr(author_name == parent(name))),
  has_active_profile: exists(Profile, active == true and name == parent(name))
})
```


<!-- ash:aggregates-end -->
<!-- ash:authorization-start -->
## ash:authorization usage
# Authorization

- When performing administrative actions, you can bypass authorization with `authorize?: false`
- To run actions as a particular user, look that user up and pass it as the `actor` option
- Always set the actor on the query/changeset/input, not when calling the action
- Use policies to define authorization rules

```elixir
# Good
Post
|> Ash.Query.for_read(:read, %{}, actor: current_user)
|> Ash.read!()

# BAD, DO NOT DO THIS
Post
|> Ash.Query.for_read(:read, %{})
|> Ash.read!(actor: current_user)
```

## Policies

To use policies, add the `Ash.Policy.Authorizer` to your resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Blog,
    authorizers: [Ash.Policy.Authorizer]

  # Rest of resource definition...
end
```

## Policy Basics

Policies determine what actions on a resource are permitted for a given actor. Define policies in the `policies` block:

```elixir
policies do
  # A simple policy that applies to all read actions
  policy action_type(:read) do
    # Authorize if record is public
    authorize_if expr(public == true)

    # Authorize if actor is the owner
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)
  end

  # A policy for create actions
  policy action_type(:create) do
    # Only allow active users to create records
    forbid_unless actor_attribute_equals(:active, true)

    # Ensure the record being created relates to the actor
    authorize_if relating_to_actor(:owner)
  end
end
```

## Policy Evaluation Flow

Policies evaluate from top to bottom with the following logic:

1. All policies that apply to an action must pass for the action to be allowed
2. Within each policy, checks evaluate from top to bottom
3. The first check that produces a decision determines the policy result
4. If no check produces a decision, the policy defaults to forbidden

## IMPORTANT: Policy Check Logic

**the first check that yields a result determines the policy outcome**

```elixir
# WRONG - This is OR logic, not AND logic!
policy action_type(:update) do
  authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:admin?, true)    # If this passes, policy passes
  authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)           # Only checked if first fails
end
```

To require BOTH conditions in that example, you would use `forbid_unless` for the first condition:

```elixir
# CORRECT - This requires BOTH conditions
policy action_type(:update) do
  forbid_unless actor_attribute_equals(:admin?, true)  # Must be admin
  authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)           # AND must be owner
end
```

Alternative patterns for AND logic:
- Use multiple separate policies (each must pass independently)
- Use a single complex expression with `expr(condition1 and condition2)`
- Use `forbid_unless` for required conditions, then `authorize_if` for the final check

## Bypass Policies

Use bypass policies to allow certain actors to bypass other policy restrictions. This should be used almost exclusively for admin bypasses.

```elixir
policies do
  # Bypass policy for admins - if this passes, other policies don't need to pass
  bypass actor_attribute_equals(:admin, true) do
    authorize_if always()
  end

  # Regular policies follow...
  policy action_type(:read) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

## Field Policies

Field policies control access to specific fields (attributes, calculations, aggregates):

```elixir
field_policies do
  # Only supervisors can see the salary field
  field_policy :salary do
    authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:role, :supervisor)
  end

  # Allow access to all other fields
  field_policy :* do
    authorize_if always()
  end
end
```

## Policy Checks

There are two main types of checks used in policies:

1. **Simple checks** - Return true/false answers (e.g., "is the actor an admin?")
2. **Filter checks** - Return filters to apply to data (e.g., "only show records owned by the actor")

You can use built-in checks or create custom ones:

```elixir
# Built-in checks
authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:role, :admin)
authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)
authorize_if expr(public == true)

# Custom check module
authorize_if MyApp.Checks.ActorHasPermission
```

### Custom Policy Checks

Create custom checks by implementing `Ash.Policy.SimpleCheck` or `Ash.Policy.FilterCheck`:

```elixir
# Simple check - returns true/false
defmodule MyApp.Checks.ActorHasRole do
  use Ash.Policy.SimpleCheck

  def match?(%{role: actor_role}, _context, opts) do
    actor_role == (opts[:role] || :admin)
  end
  def match?(_, _, _), do: false
end

# Filter check - returns query filter
defmodule MyApp.Checks.VisibleToUserLevel do
  use Ash.Policy.FilterCheck

  def filter(actor, _authorizer, _opts) do
    expr(visibility_level <= ^actor.user_level)
  end
end

# Usage
policy action_type(:read) do
  authorize_if {MyApp.Checks.ActorHasRole, role: :manager}
  authorize_if MyApp.Checks.VisibleToUserLevel
end
```

<!-- ash:calculations-start -->
## ash:calculations usage
# Calculations

Calculations allow you to define derived values based on a resource's attributes or related data. Define calculations in the `calculations` block of a resource:

```elixir
calculations do
  # Simple expression calculation
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> " " <> last_name)

  # Expression with conditions
  calculate :status_label, :string, expr(
    cond do
      status == :active -> "Active"
      status == :pending -> "Pending Review"
      true -> "Inactive"
    end
  )

  # Using module calculations for more complex logic
  calculate :risk_score, :integer, {MyApp.Calculations.RiskScore, min: 0, max: 100}
end
```

## Expression Calculations

Expression calculations use Ash expressions and can be pushed down to the data layer when possible:

```elixir
calculations do
  # Simple string concatenation
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> " " <> last_name)

  # Math operations
  calculate :total_with_tax, :decimal, expr(amount * (1 + tax_rate))

  # Date manipulation
  calculate :days_since_created, :integer, expr(
    date_diff(^now(), inserted_at, :day)
  )
end
```

## Expressions

In order to use expressions outside of resources, changes, preparations etc. you will need to use `Ash.Expr`.

It provides both `expr/1` and template helpers like `actor/1` and `arg/1`.

For example:

```elixir
import Ash.Expr

Author
|> Ash.Query.aggregate(:count_of_my_favorited_posts, :count, [:posts], query: [
  filter: expr(favorited_by(user_id: ^actor(:id)))
])
```

See the expressions guide for more information on what is available in expresisons and
how to use them.

## Module Calculations

For complex calculations, create a module that implements `Ash.Resource.Calculation`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Calculations.FullName do
  use Ash.Resource.Calculation

  # Validate and transform options
  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    {:ok, Map.put_new(opts, :separator, " ")}
  end

  # Specify what data needs to be loaded
  @impl true
  def load(_query, _opts, _context) do
    [:first_name, :last_name]
  end

  # Implement the calculation logic
  @impl true
  def calculate(records, opts, _context) do
    Enum.map(records, fn record ->
      [record.first_name, record.last_name]
      |> Enum.reject(&is_nil/1)
      |> Enum.join(opts.separator)
    end)
  end
end

# Usage in a resource
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, {MyApp.Calculations.FullName, separator: ", "}
end
```

## Calculations with Arguments

You can define calculations that accept arguments:

```elixir
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> ^arg(:separator) <> last_name) do
    argument :separator, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      default " "
      constraints [allow_empty?: true, trim?: false]
    end
  end
end
```

## Using Calculations

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
users = MyDomain.list_users!(load: [full_name: [separator: ", "]])

# Filtering and sorting
users = MyDomain.list_users!(
  query: [
    filter: [full_name: [separator: " ", value: "John Doe"]],
    sort: [full_name: {[separator: " "], :asc}]
  ]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
User |> Ash.Query.load(full_name: [separator: ", "]) |> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(users, :full_name)
```

### Code Interface for Calculations

Define calculation functions on your domain for standalone use:

```elixir
# In your domain
resource User do
  define_calculation :full_name, args: [:first_name, :last_name, {:optional, :separator}]
end

# Then call it directly
MyDomain.full_name("John", "Doe", ", ")  # Returns "John, Doe"
```

## ash:code_interfaces usage
# Code Interfaces

Domains and Resources can define code interfaces. Prefer writing code interfaces instead of regular elixir functions.

Use code interfaces on domains to define the contract for calling into Ash resources. See the [Code interface guide for more](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/code-interfaces.html).

Define code interfaces on the domain, like this:

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :fun_name, action: :action_name
end
```

For more complex interfaces with custom transformations:

```elixir
define :custom_action do
  action :action_name
  args [:arg1, :arg2]

  custom_input :arg1, MyType do
    transform do
      to :target_field
      using &MyModule.transform_function/1
    end
  end
end
```

Prefer using the primary read action for "get" style code interfaces, and using `get_by` when the field you are looking up by is the primary key or has an `identity` on the resource.

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :get_thing, action: :read, get_by: [:id]
end
```

**Avoid direct Ash calls in web modules** - Don't use `Ash.get!/2` and `Ash.load!/2` directly in LiveViews/Controllers, similar to avoiding `Repo.get/2` outside context modules:

You can also pass additional inputs in to code interfaces before the options:

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :create, action: :action_name, args: [:field1]
end
```

```elixir
Domain.create!(field1_value, %{field2: field2_value}, actor: current_user)
```

You should generally prefer using this map of extra inputs over defining optional arguments.

```elixir
# BAD - in LiveView/Controller
group = MyApp.Resource |> Ash.get!(id) |> Ash.load!(rel: [:nested])

# GOOD - use code interface with get_by
resource DashboardGroup do
  define :get_dashboard_group_by_id, action: :read, get_by: [:id]
end

# Then call:
MyApp.Domain.get_dashboard_group_by_id!(id, load: [rel: [:nested]])
```

**Code interface options** - Prefer passing options directly to code interface functions rather than building queries manually:

```elixir
# PREFERRED - Use the query option for filter, sort, limit, etc.
# the query option is passed to `Ash.Query.build/2`
posts = MyApp.Blog.list_posts!(
  query: [
    filter: [status: :published],
    sort: [published_at: :desc],
    limit: 10
  ],
  load: [author: :profile, comments: [:author]]
)

# All query-related options go in the query parameter
users = MyApp.Accounts.list_users!(
  query: [filter: [active: true], sort: [created_at: :desc]],
  load: [:profile]
)

# AVOID - Verbose manual query building
query = MyApp.Post |> Ash.Query.filter(...) |> Ash.Query.load(...)
posts = Ash.read!(query)
```

Supported options: `load:`, `query:` (which accepts `filter:`, `sort:`, `limit:`, `offset:`, etc.), `page:`, `stream?:`

**Using Scopes in LiveViews** - When using `Ash.Scope`, the scope will typically be assigned to `scope` in LiveViews and used like so:

```elixir
# In your LiveView
MyApp.Blog.create_post!("new post", scope: socket.assigns.scope)
```

Inside action hooks and callbacks, use the provided `context` parameter as your scope instead:

```elixir
|> Ash.Changeset.before_transaction(fn changeset, context ->
  MyApp.ExternalService.reserve_inventory(changeset, scope: context)
  changeset
end)
```

## Predicate interfaces (`?`-suffixed names)

When a code interface name ends in `?` (e.g. `define :user_exists?, action: :user_exists?, args: [:email]`), Ash treats it as a **predicate interface** and generates two action functions (same pattern as calculation interfaces):

- `user_exists/…` (with `?` stripped from the name) returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` (from `:action`)
- `user_exists?/…` returns the **unwrapped result** (typically bare `true`/`false`); raises on failure (from `:action!`)
- **No** `user_exists!/…` or `user_exists?!/…`

The action's `run` callback still returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`; the code interface unwraps it for the `?`-suffixed function.

Authorization helpers for predicate interfaces:

- `can_user_exists/…` returns `{:ok, true/false}` or `{:error, reason}`
- `can_user_exists?/…` returns a bare boolean
- **No** `can_user_exists??/…` is generated

Both action functions come from the default `functions:` list (`:action` and `:action!`). Omit `:action` to skip the tuple form; omit `:action!` to skip the predicate form. See the [Code interface guide](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/code-interfaces.html) for examples.

## Authorization Functions

For predicate interfaces (names ending in `?`), see [Predicate interfaces](#predicate-interfaces-suffixed-names) above for naming rules.

For each action defined in a code interface, Ash automatically generates corresponding authorization check functions:

- `can_action_name?(actor, params \\ %{}, opts \\ [])` - Returns `true`/`false` for authorization checks
- `can_action_name(actor, params \\ %{}, opts \\ [])` - Returns `{:ok, true/false}` or `{:error, reason}`

Example usage:
```elixir
# Check if user can create a post
if MyApp.Blog.can_create_post?(current_user) do
  # Show create button
end

# Check if user can update a specific post
if MyApp.Blog.can_update_post?(current_user, post) do
  # Show edit button
end

# Check if user can destroy a specific comment
if MyApp.Blog.can_destroy_comment?(current_user, comment) do
  # Show delete button
end
```

These functions are particularly useful for conditional rendering of UI elements based on user permissions.


<!-- ash:code_interfaces-end -->
<!-- ash:code_structure-start -->
## ash:code_structure usage
# Code Structure & Organization

- Organize code around domains and resources
- Each resource should be focused and well-named
- Create domain-specific actions rather than generic CRUD operations
- Put business logic inside actions rather than in external modules
- Use resources to model your domain entities

<!-- ash:code_structure-end -->
<!-- ash:data_layers-start -->
## ash:data_layers usage
# Data Layers

Data layers determine how resources are stored and retrieved. Examples of data layers:

- **Postgres**: For storing resources in PostgreSQL (via `AshPostgres`)
- **ETS**: For in-memory storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Ets`)
- **Mnesia**: For distributed storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia`)
- **Embedded**: For resources embedded in other resources (`data_layer: :embedded`) (typically JSON under the hood)
- **Ash.DataLayer.Simple**: For resources that aren't persisted at all. Leave off the data layer, as this is the default.

Specify a data layer when defining a resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Blog,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "posts"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  # ... attributes, relationships, etc.
end
```

For embedded resources:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Address do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: :embedded

  attributes do
    attribute :street, :string
    attribute :city, :string
    attribute :state, :string
    attribute :zip, :string
  end
end
```

Each data layer has its own configuration options and capabilities. Refer to the rules & documentation of the specific data layer package for more details.


<!-- ash:data_layers-end -->
<!-- ash:exist_expressions-start -->
## ash:exist_expressions usage
# Exists Expressions

Use `exists/2` to check for the existence of records, either through relationships or unrelated resources:

### Related Exists

```elixir
# Check if user has any admin roles
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(roles, name == "admin"))

# Check if post has comments with high scores
Ash.Query.filter(Post, exists(comments, score > 50))
```

### Unrelated Exists

```elixir
# Check if any profile exists with the same name
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(Profile, name == parent(name)))

# Check if user has any reports
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(Report, author_name == parent(name)))

# Complex existence checks
Ash.Query.filter(User, 
  active == true and 
  exists(Profile, active == true and name == parent(name))
)
```

Unrelated exists expressions automatically apply authorization using the target resource's primary read action. Use `parent/1` to reference fields from the source resource.

<!-- ash:exist_expressions-end -->
<!-- ash:generating_code-start -->
## ash:generating_code usage
# Generating Code

Use `mix ash.gen.*` tasks as a basis for code generation when possible. Check the task docs with `mix help <task>`.
Be sure to use `--yes` to bypass confirmation prompts. Use `--yes --dry-run` to preview the changes.


<!-- ash:generating_code-end -->
<!-- ash:migrations-start -->
## ash:migrations usage
# Migrations and Schema Changes

After creating or modifying Ash code, run `mix ash.codegen <short_name_describing_changes>` to ensure any required additional changes are made (like migrations are generated). The name of the migration should be lower_snake_case. In a longer running dev session it's usually better to use `mix ash.codegen --dev` as you go and at the end run the final codegen with a sensible name describing all the changes made in the session.


<!-- ash:migrations-end -->
<!-- ash:query_filter-start -->
## ash:query_filter usage
# Ash.Query.filter is a macro

**Important**: You must `require Ash.Query` if you want to use `Ash.Query.filter/2`, as it is a macro.

If you see errors like the following:

```
Ash.Query.filter(MyResource, id == ^id)
error: misplaced operator ^id

The pin operator ^ is supported only inside matches or inside custom macros...
```

```
iex(3)> Ash.Query.filter(MyResource, something == true)
error: undefined variable "something"
└─ iex:3
```

You are very likely missing a `require Ash.Query`

## Common Query Operations

- **Filter**: `Ash.Query.filter(query, field == value)`
- **Sort**: `Ash.Query.sort(query, field: :asc)`
- **Load relationships**: `Ash.Query.load(query, [:author, :comments])`
- **Limit**: `Ash.Query.limit(query, 10)`
- **Offset**: `Ash.Query.offset(query, 20)`


<!-- ash:query_filter-end -->
<!-- ash:querying_data-start -->
## ash:querying_data usage
# Querying Data

Use `Ash.Query` to build queries for reading data from your resources. The query module provides a declarative way to filter, sort, and load data.


<!-- ash:querying_data-end -->
<!-- ash:relationships-start -->
## ash:relationships usage
# Relationships

Relationships describe connections between resources and are a core component of Ash. Define relationships in the `relationships` block of a resource.

## Best Practices for Relationships

- Be descriptive with relationship names (e.g., use `:authored_posts` instead of just `:posts`)
- Configure foreign key constraints in your data layer if they have them (see `references` in AshPostgres)
- Always choose the appropriate relationship type based on your domain model

### Relationship Types

- For Polymorphic relationships, you can model them using `Ash.Type.Union`; see the “Polymorphic Relationships” guide for more information.

```elixir
relationships do
  # belongs_to - adds foreign key to source resource
  belongs_to :owner, MyApp.User do
    allow_nil? false
    attribute_type :integer  # defaults to :uuid
  end

  # has_one - foreign key on destination resource
  has_one :profile, MyApp.Profile

  # has_many - foreign key on destination resource, returns list
  has_many :posts, MyApp.Post do
    filter expr(published == true)
    sort published_at: :desc
  end

  # many_to_many - requires join resource
  many_to_many :tags, MyApp.Tag do
    through MyApp.PostTag
    source_attribute_on_join_resource :post_id
    destination_attribute_on_join_resource :tag_id
  end
end
```

The join resource must be defined separately:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PostTag do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    # Add additional attributes if you need metadata on the relationship
    attribute :added_at, :utc_datetime_usec do
      default &DateTime.utc_now/0
    end
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :post, MyApp.Post, primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false
    belongs_to :tag, MyApp.Tag, primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:read, :destroy, create: :*, update: :*]
  end
end
```

## Loading Relationships

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
post = MyDomain.get_post!(id, load: [:author, comments: [:author]])

# Complex loading with filters
posts = MyDomain.list_posts!(
  query: [load: [comments: [filter: [is_approved: true], limit: 5]]]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
MyApp.Post
|> Ash.Query.load(comments: MyApp.Comment |> Ash.Query.filter(is_approved == true))
|> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(post, :author)
```

Prefer to use the `strict?` option when loading to only load necessary fields on related data.

```elixir
MyApp.Post
|> Ash.Query.load([comments: [:title]], strict?: true)
```

## Managing Relationships

There are two primary ways to manage relationships in Ash:

### 1. Using `change manage_relationship/2-3` in Actions
Use this when input comes from action arguments:

```elixir
actions do
  update :update do
    # Define argument for the related data
    argument :comments, {:array, :map} do
      allow_nil? false
    end

    argument :new_tags, {:array, :map}

    # Link argument to relationship management
    change manage_relationship(:comments, type: :append)

    # For different argument and relationship names
    change manage_relationship(:new_tags, :tags, type: :append)
  end
end
```

### 2. Using `Ash.Changeset.manage_relationship/3-4` in Custom Changes
Use this when building values programmatically:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Changes.AssignTeamMembers do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _opts, context) do
    members = determine_team_members(changeset, context.actor)

    Ash.Changeset.manage_relationship(
      changeset,
      :members,
      members,
      type: :append_and_remove
    )
  end
end
```

### Quick Reference - Management Types
- `:append` - Add new related records, ignore existing
- `:append_and_remove` - Add new related records, remove missing
- `:remove` - Remove specified related records
- `:direct_control` - Full CRUD control (create/update/destroy)
- `:create` - Only create new records

### Quick Reference - Common Options
- `on_lookup: :relate` - Look up and relate existing records
- `on_no_match: :create` - Create if no match found
- `on_match: :update` - Update existing matches
- `on_missing: :destroy` - Delete records not in input
- `value_is_key: :name` - Use field as key for simple values

For comprehensive documentation, see the [Managing Relationships](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/relationships.html#managing-relationships) section.

### Examples

Creating a post with tags:
```elixir
MyDomain.create_post!(%{
  title: "New Post",
  body: "Content here...",
  tags: [%{name: "elixir"}, %{name: "ash"}]  # Creates new tags
})

# Updating a post to replace its tags
MyDomain.update_post!(post, %{
  tags: [tag1.id, tag2.id]  # Replaces tags with existing ones by ID
})
```


<!-- ash:relationships-end -->
<!-- ash:testing-start -->
## ash:testing usage
# Testing

When testing resources:
- Test your domain actions through the code interface
- Use test utilities in `Ash.Test`
- Test authorization policies work as expected using `Ash.can?`
- Use `authorize?: false` in tests where authorization is not the focus
- Write generators using `Ash.Generator`
- Prefer to use raising versions of functions whenever possible, as opposed to pattern matching

## Preventing Deadlocks in Concurrent Tests

When running tests concurrently, using fixed values for identity attributes can cause deadlock errors. Multiple tests attempting to create records with the same unique values will conflict.

### Use Globally Unique Values

Always use globally unique values for identity attributes in tests:

```elixir
# BAD - Can cause deadlocks in concurrent tests
%{email: "test@example.com", username: "testuser"}

# GOOD - Use globally unique values
%{
  email: "test-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}@example.com",
  username: "user_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}",
  slug: "post-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"
}
```

### Creating Reusable Test Generators

For better organization, create a generator module:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TestGenerators do
  use Ash.Generator

  def user(opts \\ []) do
    changeset_generator(
      User,
      :create,
      defaults: [
        email: "user-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}@example.com",
        username: "user_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"
      ],
      overrides: opts
    )
  end
end

# In your tests
test "concurrent user creation" do
  users = MyApp.TestGenerators.generate_many(user(), 10)
  # Each user has unique identity attributes
end
```

This applies to ANY field used in identity constraints, not just primary keys. Using globally unique values prevents frustrating intermittent test failures in CI environments.

<!-- ash:testing-end -->
<!-- phoenix:ecto-start -->
## phoenix:ecto usage
## Ecto Guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programmatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
- **Always** invoke `mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name_using_underscores` when generating migration files, so the correct timestamp and conventions are applied

<!-- phoenix:ecto-end -->
<!-- phoenix:elixir-start -->
## phoenix:elixir usage
## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

## Test guidelines

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

   - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages


<!-- phoenix:elixir-end -->
<!-- phoenix:html-start -->
## phoenix:html usage
## Phoenix HTML guidelines

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id="msg-form">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id="product-form">`)
- For "app wide" template imports, you can import/alias into the `my_app_web.ex`'s `html_helpers` block, so they will be available to all LiveViews, LiveComponent's, and all modules that do `use MyAppWeb, :html` (replace "my_app" by the actual app name)

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`**. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

  Within `phx-no-curly-interpolation` annotated tags, you can use `{` and `}` without escaping them, and dynamic Elixir expressions can still be used with `<%= ... %>` syntax

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...
      => Raises compile syntax error on invalid HEEx attr syntax

- **Never** use `<% Enum.each %>` or non-for comprehensions for generating template content, instead **always** use `<%= for item <- @collection do %>`
- HEEx HTML comments use `<%!-- comment --%>`. **Always** use the HEEx HTML comment syntax for template comments (`<%!-- comment --%>`)
- HEEx allows interpolation via `{...}` and `<%= ... %>`, but the `<%= %>` **only** works within tag bodies. **Always** use the `{...}` syntax for interpolation within tag attributes, and for interpolation of values within tag bodies. **Always** interpolate block constructs (if, cond, case, for) within tag bodies using `<%= ... %>`.

  **Always** do this:

      <div id={@id}>
        {@my_assign}
        <%= if @some_block_condition do %>
          {@another_assign}
        <% end %>
      </div>

  and **Never** do this – the program will terminate with a syntax error:

      <%!-- THIS IS INVALID NEVER EVER DO THIS --%>
      <div id="<%= @invalid_interpolation %>">
        {if @invalid_block_construct do}
        {end}
      </div>

<!-- phoenix:html-end -->
<!-- phoenix:liveview-start -->
## phoenix:liveview usage
## Phoenix LiveView guidelines

- **Never** use the deprecated `live_redirect` and `live_patch` functions, instead **always** use the `<.link navigate={href}>` and  `<.link patch={href}>` in templates, and `push_navigate` and `push_patch` functions LiveViews
- **Avoid LiveComponent's** unless you have a strong, specific need for them
- LiveViews should be named like `AppWeb.WeatherLive`, with a `Live` suffix. When you go to add LiveView routes to the router, the default `:browser` scope is **already aliased** with the `AppWeb` module, so you can just do `live "/weather", WeatherLive`

### LiveView streams

- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`

- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child. For a call like `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])` in the LiveView, the template would be:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, msg} <- @streams.messages} id={id}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      </div>

- LiveView streams are *not* enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**:

      def handle_event("filter", %{"filter" => filter}, socket) do
        # re-fetch the messages based on the filter
        messages = list_messages(filter)

        {:noreply,
         socket
         |> assign(:messages_empty?, messages == [])
         # reset the stream with the new messages
         |> stream(:messages, messages, reset: true)}
      end

- LiveView streams *do not support counting or empty states*. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes:

      <div id="tasks" phx-update="stream">
        <div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>
        <div :for={{id, task} <- @streams.tasks} id={id}>
          {task.name}
        </div>
      </div>

  The above only works if the empty state is the only HTML block alongside the stream for-comprehension.

- When updating an assign that should change content inside any streamed item(s), you MUST re-stream the items
  along with the updated assign:

      def handle_event("edit_message", %{"message_id" => message_id}, socket) do
        message = Chat.get_message!(message_id)
        edit_form = to_form(Chat.change_message(message, %{content: message.content}))

        # re-insert message so @editing_message_id toggle logic takes effect for that stream item
        {:noreply,
         socket
         |> stream_insert(:messages, message)
         |> assign(:editing_message_id, String.to_integer(message_id))
         |> assign(:edit_form, edit_form)}
      end

  And in the template:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, message} <- @streams.messages} id={id} class="flex group">
          {message.username}
          <%= if @editing_message_id == message.id do %>
            <%!-- Edit mode --%>
            <.form for={@edit_form} id="edit-form-#{message.id}" phx-submit="save_edit">
              ...
            </.form>
          <% end %>
        </div>
      </div>

- **Never** use the deprecated `phx-update="append"` or `phx-update="prepend"` for collections

### LiveView JavaScript interop

- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that JS hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Always** provide an unique DOM id alongside `phx-hook` otherwise a compiler error will be raised

LiveView hooks come in two flavors, 1) colocated js hooks for "inline" scripts defined inside HEEx,
and 2) external `phx-hook` annotations where JavaScript object literals are defined and passed to the `LiveSocket` constructor.

#### Inline colocated js hooks

**Never** write raw embedded `<script>` tags in heex as they are incompatible with LiveView.
Instead, **always use a colocated js hook script tag (`:type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook}`)
when writing scripts inside the template**:

    <input type="text" name="user[phone_number]" id="user-phone-number" phx-hook=".PhoneNumber" />
    <script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook} name=".PhoneNumber">
      export default {
        mounted() {
          this.el.addEventListener("input", e => {
            let match = this.el.value.replace(/\D/g, "").match(/^(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})$/)
            if(match) {
              this.el.value = `${match[1]}-${match[2]}-${match[3]}`
            }
          })
        }
      }
    </script>

- colocated hooks are automatically integrated into the app.js bundle
- colocated hooks names **MUST ALWAYS** start with a `.` prefix, i.e. `.PhoneNumber`

#### External phx-hook

External JS hooks (`<div id="myhook" phx-hook="MyHook">`) must be placed in `assets/js/` and passed to the
LiveSocket constructor:

    const MyHook = {
      mounted() { ... }
    }
    let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
      hooks: { MyHook }
    });

#### Pushing events between client and server

Use LiveView's `push_event/3` when you need to push events/data to the client for a phx-hook to handle.
**Always** return or rebind the socket on `push_event/3` when pushing events:

    # re-bind socket so we maintain event state to be pushed
    socket = push_event(socket, "my_event", %{...})

    # or return the modified socket directly:
    def handle_event("some_event", _, socket) do
      {:noreply, push_event(socket, "my_event", %{...})}
    end

Pushed events can then be picked up in a JS hook with `this.handleEvent`:

    mounted() {
      this.handleEvent("my_event", data => console.log("from server:", data));
    }

Clients can also push an event to the server and receive a reply with `this.pushEvent`:

    mounted() {
      this.el.addEventListener("click", e => {
        this.pushEvent("my_event", { one: 1 }, reply => console.log("got reply from server:", reply));
      })
    }

Where the server handled it via:

    def handle_event("my_event", %{"one" => 1}, socket) do
      {:reply, %{two: 2}, socket}
    end

### LiveView tests

- `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` module and `LazyHTML` (included) for making your assertions
- Form tests are driven by `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`'s `render_submit/2` and `render_change/2` functions
- Come up with a step-by-step test plan that splits major test cases into small, isolated files. You may start with simpler tests that verify content exists, gradually add interaction tests
- **Always reference the key element IDs you added in the LiveView templates in your tests** for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` functions like `element/2`, `has_element/2`, selectors, etc
- **Never** tests again raw HTML, **always** use `element/2`, `has_element/2`, and similar: `assert has_element?(view, "#my-form")`
- Instead of relying on testing text content, which can change, favor testing for the presence of key elements
- Focus on testing outcomes rather than implementation details
- Be aware that `Phoenix.Component` functions like `<.form>` might produce different HTML than expected. Test against the output HTML structure, not your mental model of what you expect it to be
- When facing test failures with element selectors, add debug statements to print the actual HTML, but use `LazyHTML` selectors to limit the output, ie:

      html = render(view)
      document = LazyHTML.from_fragment(html)
      matches = LazyHTML.filter(document, "your-complex-selector")
      IO.inspect(matches, label: "Matches")

### Form handling

#### Creating a form from params

If you want to create a form based on `handle_event` params:

    def handle_event("submitted", params, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(params))}
    end

When you pass a map to `to_form/1`, it assumes said map contains the form params, which are expected to have string keys.

You can also specify a name to nest the params:

    def handle_event("submitted", %{"user" => user_params}, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(user_params, as: :user))}
    end

#### Creating a form from changesets

When using changesets, the underlying data, form params, and errors are retrieved from it. The `:as` option is automatically computed too. E.g. if you have a user schema:

    defmodule MyApp.Users.User do
      use Ecto.Schema
      ...
    end

And then you create a changeset that you pass to `to_form`:

    %MyApp.Users.User{}
    |> Ecto.Changeset.change()
    |> to_form()

Once the form is submitted, the params will be available under `%{"user" => user_params}`.

In the template, the form form assign can be passed to the `<.form>` function component:

    <.form for={@form} id="todo-form" phx-change="validate" phx-submit="save">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

Always give the form an explicit, unique DOM ID, like `id="todo-form"`.

#### Avoiding form errors

**Always** use a form assigned via `to_form/2` in the LiveView, and the `<.input>` component in the template. In the template **always access forms this**:

    <%!-- ALWAYS do this (valid) --%>
    <.form for={@form} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

And **never** do this:

    <%!-- NEVER do this (invalid) --%>
    <.form for={@changeset} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@changeset[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

- You are FORBIDDEN from accessing the changeset in the template as it will cause errors
- **Never** use `<.form let={f} ...>` in the template, instead **always use `<.form for={@form} ...>`**, then drive all form references from the form assign as in `@form[:field]`. The UI should **always** be driven by a `to_form/2` assigned in the LiveView module that is derived from a changeset

## phoenix:phoenix usage
## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
