## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository,
please report it via [GitHub Security Vulnerability Reporting][github-private-vulnerability-reporting]
at `github.com/erlef-cna/varsel/security/advisories/new`
or via email to [`cna@erlef.org`][email] if that is more suitable for you.

**Please do not report vulnerabilities through public channels** such as GitHub
issues, discussions, or pull requests, to avoid exposing the details of the
issue before it has been properly addressed.

We don't implement a bug bounty program or bounty rewards, but will work with
you to ensure that your findings get the appropriate handling.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much detail as possible to
help us triage and resolve the issue efficiently. Information that will be
specially helpful includes:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- The location of the affected source code (e.g., tag, branch, commit, or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- The potential impact, including how the issue might be exploited by an attacker

Our vulnerability management team will respond within 3 working days of your
report. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security
Advisory. This project follows a 90-day disclosure timeline.

If you have any questions about reporting security issues, please contact our
vulnerability management team at [`cna@erlef.org`][email].
